<h3> Twenty Five Twenty One</h3>
<p>Na Hee Do's character is really Inspirational. Motivates me to chase my dreams.</p>

<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>It was my first anime ever and it has a special place in my heart. Also I've watched all the Japanese live action adaptations of this series. They were really good too.</p>
